# csa-textual-character

This repository includes data and code to accompany my paper 'The Textual Character of Codex Sinaiticus Arabicus and its Family' which I delivered at the 11th [Birmingham Colloquium on the Textual Criticism of the New Testament](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/itsee/events/bham-colloquium.aspx) in March, 2019. The print version of the paper is forthcoming.

## Quantifying Similarity

There is a Python notebook which demonstrates how to implement and use some of the formulas that I discuss in the paper. A [static version is available on Github](../blob/master/QuantifyingSimilarity.ipynb) and an [interactive version can be opened here or in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rbturnbull/csa-textual-character/blob/master/QuantifyingSimilarity.ipynb).
